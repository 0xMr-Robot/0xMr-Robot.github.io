### *"Sometimes I dream of saving the world. Saving everyone from the invisible hand... the one that controls us every day but we don‚Äôt know it."*  
As a **Reverse Engineer**, **Malware Analyst**, and **Cybersecurity Specialist**, I‚Äôve dedicated my journey to understanding and dismantling the hidden threats that infiltrate our digital landscape. Whether through **reverse engineering malicious software** or **educating future cybersecurity experts**, my goal is to stand on the frontlines of this invisible war‚Äîunraveling the intricacies of malware and defending against cyber threats that most people can‚Äôt even see.

## üîç Specializations in Cybersecurity
*"Control is an illusion, but sometimes you need the illusion to gain control."*  
Control is at the heart of what I do‚Äîcontrol over the systems that attackers seek to exploit. In my work as a **malware analyst**, I dig deep into the **binary code of malicious programs**, peeling back layers to discover the strategies and mechanisms used by attackers. My **reverse engineering** skills allow me to gain insights into **zero-day vulnerabilities** and hidden functionalities, giving defenders the power to patch weaknesses and eliminate threats.

I specialize in:
- **Malware Analysis**: Identifying, deconstructing, and analyzing **malicious software** to detect attack vectors and behaviors.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Using tools like **Ghidra**, **IDA Pro**, and **x64dbg**, I reverse-engineer binaries to reveal their secrets and **decode encrypted payloads**.
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges**: Competitive CTF events have sharpened my skills in **real-world problem-solving** and **exploit development**.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gathering and analyzing cyber threat data to prevent attacks before they happen, and **crafting countermeasures** against emerging threats.

## üéØ Professional Experience  
*"There‚Äôs a code even in the chaos, and my job is to find it."*  
My journey through the world of cybersecurity is one driven by curiosity and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. Each role I‚Äôve taken on has pushed me further into the depths of **cyber defense and attack methodologies**, challenging me to solve complex puzzles in order to keep systems safe. My professional experience highlights the blend of offensive and defensive strategies required to survive in this world of ever-evolving threats.

### **CTF Developer & Author at CyberTalents**
At **CyberTalents**, I developed **reverse engineering** challenges that forced participants to think like attackers. My challenges, based on **real-world malware** and advanced **obfuscation techniques**, helped participants hone their skills in identifying exploits and decoding encrypted data.

- Created challenges based on **malware obfuscation**, **file analysis**, and **runtime behavior**.
- Crafted **step-by-step solutions** for participants, guiding them through each layer of the problem-solving process.
- Collaborated with other experts to continuously update and create new challenges.

### **Malware Analyst at Flothers**
Working as a **Malware Analyst** at Flothers, I was responsible for **analyzing malicious software** encountered in the wild. Using **dynamic and static analysis** methods, I broke down malware samples, identifying **command and control infrastructure**, and **exploit techniques** used by advanced threat actors.

- Uncovered new strains of **ransomware**, **botnets**, and **Trojans**.
- Developed comprehensive reports detailing malware behavior and recommended defense strategies.
- Worked closely with other analysts to **reverse-engineer** samples and share intelligence with the broader community.

### **Cybersecurity Instructor at Kian Academy**
*"A bug is never just a mistake. It represents something deeper‚Äîan opportunity to uncover a hidden vulnerability."*  
As an instructor, I taught students to not only **find bugs** but to see them for what they are: gateways into deeper systems. My classes focused on **hands-on cybersecurity training**, where students would tackle **real-world CTF challenges** and **reverse engineering exercises** under my guidance.

- Led courses on **malware analysis**, **reverse engineering**, and **incident response**.
- Developed an extensive curriculum tailored to **offensive and defensive** cybersecurity.
- Mentored students on practical application of cybersecurity knowledge in **real-world scenarios**.

### **SOC Analyst Intern at CyberTalents**
During my internship as a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst**, I focused on **monitoring and analyzing security events** in real-time. I assisted in **triaging alerts**, performing **threat hunting** tasks, and **identifying vulnerabilities** in client systems.

- Analyzed and categorized thousands of **security alerts** from different sectors.
- Developed **threat detection rules** based on emerging attack patterns.
- Worked with senior analysts to conduct **incident response** for ongoing cyber attacks.
