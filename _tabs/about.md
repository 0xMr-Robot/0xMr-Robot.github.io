### *"Sometimes I dream of saving the world. Saving everyone from the invisible hand... the one that controls us every day but we don‚Äôt know it."*  
As a **Reverse Engineer**, **Malware Analyst**, and **Cybersecurity Specialist**, I‚Äôve dedicated my journey to understanding and dismantling the hidden threats that infiltrate our digital landscape. Whether through **reverse engineering malicious software** or **educating future cybersecurity experts**, my goal is to stand on the frontlines of this invisible war‚Äîunraveling the intricacies of malware and defending against cyber threats that most people can‚Äôt even see.

## üîç Specializations in Cybersecurity
*"Control is an illusion, but sometimes you need the illusion to gain control."*  
Control is at the heart of what I do‚Äîcontrol over the systems that attackers seek to exploit. In my work as a **malware analyst**, I dig deep into the **binary code of malicious programs**, peeling back layers to discover the strategies and mechanisms used by attackers. My **reverse engineering** skills allow me to gain insights into **zero-day vulnerabilities** and hidden functionalities, giving defenders the power to patch weaknesses and eliminate threats.

I specialize in:
- **Malware Analysis**: Identifying, deconstructing, and analyzing **malicious software** to detect attack vectors and behaviors.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Using tools like **Ghidra**, **IDA Pro**, and **x64dbg**, I reverse-engineer binaries to reveal their secrets and **decode encrypted payloads**.
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges**: Competitive CTF events have sharpened my skills in **real-world problem-solving** and **exploit development**.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gathering and analyzing cyber threat data to prevent attacks before they happen, and **crafting countermeasures** against emerging threats.
